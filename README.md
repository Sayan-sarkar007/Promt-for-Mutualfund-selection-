# Promt-for-Mutualfund-selection-

## Prompt - 

Hey GPT, I am planning to invest in Indian mutual funds. I am looking to invest for both short-term (approximately 5-10 years) and long-term (approximately 15-20 years).

Please provide an overview of the 5 best mutual funds for each investment horizon as per todayâ€™s data in India.

The funds should include top performers from equity, hybrid, and debt categories, based on their 3-5 year returns. Consider criteria like exit load, expense ratio, and ensure there is no lock-in period.

For each fund, mention the risk level, expense ratio, fund size, fund manager, and if possible include the minimum investment amount.
